Castro-Camilo (UofG)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Data fusion models are increasingly used to combine in situ and remote-sensing data, providing a more complete and temporally detailed picture of environmental conditions. However, traditional Gaussian-based models tend to underestimate extreme pollution events, which can lead to inaccurate risk assessments. To tackle this, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical framework for data fusion grounded in extreme value theory. Our approach employs the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution, allowing us to model both threshold and non-threshold exceedances while maintaining the temporal structure of extreme events. We apply this model to predict and describe censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution across Greater London, using remote sensing data from the EAC4 dataset (part of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service) alongside in situ measurements from the UK‚Äôs Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). Key contributions of our approach lie in our model‚Äôs ability to (1) preserve the temporal structure of both extreme and non-extreme events, (2) seamlessly integrate data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions while fully accounting for parameter uncertainties, and (3) generate a complete spatio-temporal dataset that calibrates remote-sensing observations to accurately capture local threshold exceedances, guided by in situ measurements. Our results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms both Gaussian-based models and standalone remote-sensing data, providing more accurate predictions of threshold exceedances. In fact, it reveals finer spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution, such as higher concentrations near coastal areas, which were not captured by remote sensing data alone.\nJoint work with: M. Daniela Cuba (Agricarbon, UofG), Craig Wilkie (UofG) and Marian Scott (UofG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14/02/25 Radial generalized Pareto distributions for extreme multivariate risk by I. Papastathopoulos (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary We introduce a novel class of multivariate distributions, termed radial generalized Pareto distributions, which emerge as non-degenerate limits of radially recentered and rescaled exceedances above direction-dependent thresholds. This framework leverages a novel convergence to Poisson point processes for multivariate extremes, providing an overarching stochastic foundation for constructing distributions that exhibit stability properties, enabling extrapolation of risk in any direction within multivariate spaces. Our framework naturally leads to the notion of quantile and return sets which closely parallel related notions of quantile regions that are based on optimal transport approaches, but also leads to isotropic return sets that are exceeded with equal probability along any direction.\nWe develop a fully Bayesian inference framework for these multivariate distributions, utilising latent Gaussian processes. We also construct novel diagnostics for assessing the convergence to the limit distribution and validate our methods through simulations. Our methods are also applied to real-world data from hydrology and oceanography, demonstrating their broad applicability in risk analysis and their potential to inform decision-making in the presence of extreme events.\nJoint work with: Lambert De Monte (University of Edinburgh), Ryan Campbell (Lancaster University) and Haavard Rue (KAUST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15/11/25 A Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Neural Model for Cascading Extremes by M. de Carvalho (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary In this talk I will address the growing concern of cascading extreme events, such as a tsunami followed by an extreme earthquake, by presenting a novel method for risk assessment focused on these domino effects. The proposed method develops an extreme value theory framework within a Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Neural Network (KAN) to estimate the probability of one extreme event triggering another, as a function of a covariate or feature vector. Our approach is backed by exhaustive numerical studies and illustrated on a real-life application to seismology.\nJoint work with: C. Ferrer and R.

Richards (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary he geometric representation for multivariate extremes, where data is split into radial and angular components and the radial component is modelled conditionally on the angle, provides an exciting new approach to modelling environmental data. Through a consideration of scaled sample clouds and limit sets, it provides a flexible, semi-parametric model for extremes that connects multiple classical extremal dependence measures; these include the coefficients of tail dependence and asymptotic independence, and parameters of the conditional extremes framework. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool for environmental data, its inference is limited to a low dimensional setting (d ‚â§ 3).\nWe propose here the first deep representation for geometric extremes. By leveraging the predictive power and computational scalability of neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependence between metocean variables sampled from the North Sea.\nJoint work with: Callum JR Murphy-Barltrop and Reetam Majumder\nSlides: click here"

These estimators are likelihood-free and amortised, in the sense that, after an initial setup cost, inference from observed data can be made in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches, e.g., MCMC or maximum likelihood estimation. They are also approximate Bayes estimators and, therefore, are often referred to as neural Bayes estimators. We present the user-friendly R package NeuralEstimators, which interfaces with the Julia package NeuralEstimators.jl, and allows for the development and application of neural Bayes estimators. This package caters for any model for which simulation is feasible by allowing the user to implicitly define their model via simulated data. No likelihood or long MCMC chains required!\nMore information here.\n\n\n\nüìå GLE\\(^2\\)N-sponsored UofE Stats seminar: Ilaria Prosdocimi and Isadora Antoniano Villalobos (Ca‚Äô Foscari University of Venice)\nThe UofE Stats seminar taking place the last week of February is a joint venture with GLE\\(^2\\)N.

This study investigates and compares the performance of recently proposed multivariate extreme value models in describing such features, while allowing for spatial variation, temporal non-stationarity and different extremal dependence regimes. We analyse data on hourly precipitation recorded at 65 sites in the period 1990‚Äì2023 across the Piave river basin in Northeastern Italy. Empirical evidence suggests that both the extremal dependence structures and the marginal behaviours of precipitation events vary throughout the year, reflecting seasonal patterns. Furthermore spatial dependence appears to weaken as precipitation events become more extreme. We investigate possible exogenous factors by introducing climatic variables as predictors for the marginal distributions, the spatial dependence and the interplay between them. We observe that capturing these features is essential to provide a realistic description of extreme precipitation processes in order to better estimate the risks associated with them.\nMore information here."
