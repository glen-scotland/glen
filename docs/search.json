To effectively capture spatial heterogeneity in distributional treatment effects, we propose a novel semiparametric neural network-based causal framework leveraging deep spatial quantile regression and then construct a plug-in estimator for spatial quantile treatment effects (SQTE). This framework incorporates an efficient adjustment procedure to mitigate the impact of spatial hidden confounders. Extensive simulations across various scenarios demonstrate that our methodology can accurately estimate SQTE, even with the presence of spatial hidden confounders. Additionally, the spatial confounding adjustment procedure effectively reduces neighborhood spatial patterns in the residuals. We apply this method to assess the spatially varying quantile treatment effects of maternal smoking on newborn birth weight in North Carolina, United States. Our findings consistently show negative effects across all birth weight quantiles, with particularly severe impacts observed in the lower quantile regions.\nJoint work with: R. Majumder, B. J.

The majority of multivariate extreme value models (MEVMs) fail to account for such trends, motivating the need for novel developments.\nMany recent MEVMs utilise the geometric extremes framework, whereby extremal dependence features are inferred from the limiting shapes of scaled sample clouds. Such approaches possess many attractive features; for example, they can capture a wide range of dependence structures and can be used to estimate many practically relevant quantities.\nIn this work, we extend the geometric extremes framework to capture time-varying extremal dependence. Our proposed framework is more flexible compared to many existing non-stationary MVEMs and offers a wide variety of interesting use cases. Through rigorous simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed framework is both robust and accurate. To conclude, we apply our framework to return data from ‘The Magnificent 7,’ a group consisting of the world’s largest technology companies.\nJoint work with: J. Wadsworth, M. de Carvalho, B.

Hu (UofG)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary The multivariate generalized Pareto distribution (mGPD) is a common method for modelling extreme threshold exceedance probabilities in environmental and financial risk management. Despite its broad applicability, mGPD faces challenges due to the infinite possible parametrizations of its dependence function, with only a few parametric models available in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce GPDFlow, an innovative mGPD model that leverages normalizing flows to flexibly represent the dependence structure. Unlike traditional parametric mGPD approaches, GPDFlow does not impose explicit parametric assumptions on dependence, resulting in greater flexibility and enhanced performance. Additionally, GPDFlow allows direct inference of marginal parameters, providing insights into marginal tail behaviour. We derive tail dependence coefficients for GPDFlow, including a bivariate formulation, a d-dimensional extension, and an alternative measure for partial exceedance dependence. A general relationship between the bivariate tail dependence coefficient and the generative samples from normalizing flows is discussed. Through simulations and a practical application analyzing the risk among five major US banks, we demonstrate that GPDFlow significantly improves modelling accuracy and flexibility compared to traditional parametric methods.\nJoint work with: Daniela Castro-Camilo (UofG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/03/25 Data fusion and extremes: a match made in Bayesian heaven by D. Castro-Camilo (UofG)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Data fusion models are increasingly used to combine in situ and remote-sensing data, providing a more complete and temporally detailed picture of environmental conditions. However, traditional Gaussian-based models tend to underestimate extreme pollution events, which can lead to inaccurate risk assessments. To tackle this, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical framework for data fusion grounded in extreme value theory. Our approach employs the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution, allowing us to model both threshold and non-threshold exceedances while maintaining the temporal structure of extreme events. We apply this model to predict and describe censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution across Greater London, using remote sensing data from the EAC4 dataset (part of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service) alongside in situ measurements from the UK’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). Key contributions of our approach lie in our model’s ability to (1) preserve the temporal structure of both extreme and non-extreme events, (2) seamlessly integrate data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions while fully accounting for parameter uncertainties, and (3) generate a complete spatio-temporal dataset that calibrates remote-sensing observations to accurately capture local threshold exceedances, guided by in situ measurements. Our results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms both Gaussian-based models and standalone remote-sensing data, providing more accurate predictions of threshold exceedances. In fact, it reveals finer spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution, such as higher concentrations near coastal areas, which were not captured by remote sensing data alone.\nJoint work with: M. Daniela Cuba (Agricarbon, UofG), Craig Wilkie (UofG) and Marian Scott (UofG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14/02/25 Radial generalized Pareto distributions for extreme multivariate risk by I. Papastathopoulos (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary We introduce a novel class of multivariate distributions, termed radial generalized Pareto distributions, which emerge as non-degenerate limits of radially recentered and rescaled exceedances above direction-dependent thresholds. This framework leverages a novel convergence to Poisson point processes for multivariate extremes, providing an overarching stochastic foundation for constructing distributions that exhibit stability properties, enabling extrapolation of risk in any direction within multivariate spaces. Our framework naturally leads to the notion of quantile and return sets which closely parallel related notions of quantile regions that are based on optimal transport approaches, but also leads to isotropic return sets that are exceeded with equal probability along any direction.\nWe develop a fully Bayesian inference framework for these multivariate distributions, utilising latent Gaussian processes. We also construct novel diagnostics for assessing the convergence to the limit distribution and validate our methods through simulations. Our methods are also applied to real-world data from hydrology and oceanography, demonstrating their broad applicability in risk analysis and their potential to inform decision-making in the presence of extreme events.\nJoint work with: Lambert De Monte (University of Edinburgh), Ryan Campbell (Lancaster University) and Haavard Rue (KAUST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15/11/25 A Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Model for Cascading Extremes by M. de Carvalho (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary In this talk I will address the growing concern of cascading extreme events, such as a tsunami followed by an extreme earthquake, by presenting a novel method for risk assessment focused on these domino effects. The proposed method develops an extreme value theory framework within a Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Network (KAN) to estimate the probability of one extreme event triggering another, as a function of a covariate or feature vector. Our approach is backed by exhaustive numerical studies and illustrated on a real-life application to seismology.\nJoint work with: C. Ferrer and R.

Richards (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary he geometric representation for multivariate extremes, where data is split into radial and angular components and the radial component is modelled conditionally on the angle, provides an exciting new approach to modelling environmental data. Through a consideration of scaled sample clouds and limit sets, it provides a flexible, semi-parametric model for extremes that connects multiple classical extremal dependence measures; these include the coefficients of tail dependence and asymptotic independence, and parameters of the conditional extremes framework. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool for environmental data, its inference is limited to a low dimensional setting (d ≤ 3).\nWe propose here the first deep representation for geometric extremes. By leveraging the predictive power and computational scalability of neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependence between metocean variables sampled from the North Sea.\nJoint work with: Callum JR Murphy-Barltrop and Reetam Majumder\nSlides: click here"

Beyond high wildfire frequency, the country has experienced devastating mega-fires, such as those in 2017. Accurate forecasting of wildfire occurrence and burned areas is therefore essential for effective firefighting resource allocation and emergency preparedness. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage ensemble model that combines XGBoost and a spatial-temporal latent Gaussian model to jointly estimate the wildfire occurrence and burn area. Initially, XGBoost identifies wildfire patterns based on meteorological covariates, coordinates, and time indicators, and its predictions are subsequently enhanced by a spatial-temporal latent Gaussian model. Our results demonstrate that this ensemble approach outperforms either method individually. To effectively model both moderate and extreme wildfire events, we employ the extended Generalized Pareto distribution (eGPD), which features a gamma-like lower bound and a Pareto-like tail. The Gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the XGBoost and Bayesian inference is conducted for the latent Gaussian model using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). Additionally, we contribute to the INLA community by implementing eGPD as a likelihood function in the R-INLA package and discussing its penalized Complexity priors (PC-priors)."

Whilst the theory of univariate extreme value statistics is relatively mature, there are still significant gaps in the theory of multivariate extremes. Many of the existing models are limited in terms of the types of joint distributions they can represent. Some models are only applicable in the region where all variables are large, whereas other methods are based on strong assumptions about the strength of dependence in the joint tails. This talk will show how univariate extreme value theory can be extended in two different ways to model multivariate extremes. In the first approach, known as the SPAR method [1-4], variables are transformed to angular and radial coordinates. After this transformation, the problem of modelling multivariate extremes is transformed to one of modelling an angular density and the tail of the radial variable, conditional on angle. We show that many existing approaches are special cases of this model, but that the SPAR framework provides greater flexibility than available with existing approaches. The second approach, known as Direct-IFORM [5], can be used to estimate half-space depth contours at extreme levels, which are routinely used for risk analysis in offshore engineering. The method has the advantage that it can be applied in any number of dimensions without loss without degradation in performance, lifting the so-called ‘curse of dimensionality’. Both methods make use of the univariate peaks-over-threshold method, giving a rigorous and asymptotically justified means for extrapolating outside the range of observations. In this talk we will give a brief introduction to theory and inference, as well as examples of their application to real-world datasets.\nReferences:\n\nE. Mackay and P.

These estimators are likelihood-free and amortised, in the sense that, after an initial setup cost, inference from observed data can be made in a fraction of the time required by conventional approaches, e.g., MCMC or maximum likelihood estimation. They are also approximate Bayes estimators and, therefore, are often referred to as neural Bayes estimators. We present the user-friendly R package NeuralEstimators, which interfaces with the Julia package NeuralEstimators.jl, and allows for the development and application of neural Bayes estimators. This package caters for any model for which simulation is feasible by allowing the user to implicitly define their model via simulated data. No likelihood or long MCMC chains required!\nMore information here.\n\n\n\n📌 GLE\\(^2\\)N-sponsored UofE Stats seminar: Ilaria Prosdocimi and Isadora Antoniano Villalobos (Ca’ Foscari University of Venice)\nThe UofE Stats seminar taking place the last week of February is a joint venture with GLE\\(^2\\)N.

This study investigates and compares the performance of recently proposed multivariate extreme value models in describing such features, while allowing for spatial variation, temporal non-stationarity and different extremal dependence regimes. We analyse data on hourly precipitation recorded at 65 sites in the period 1990–2023 across the Piave river basin in Northeastern Italy. Empirical evidence suggests that both the extremal dependence structures and the marginal behaviours of precipitation events vary throughout the year, reflecting seasonal patterns. Furthermore spatial dependence appears to weaken as precipitation events become more extreme. We investigate possible exogenous factors by introducing climatic variables as predictors for the marginal distributions, the spatial dependence and the interplay between them. We observe that capturing these features is essential to provide a realistic description of extreme precipitation processes in order to better estimate the risks associated with them.\nMore information here."

Extreme excursions of stochastic processes in space and time often appear to be more localized the more extreme they are. While classical stochastic processes in extreme value theory cannot model this effect, we introduce an adapted version, where a suitable domain-scaling can be incorporated to accommodate this behaviour. Our theory is inspired by the triangular array convergence of maxima of Gaussian processes to a Brown–Resnick process and turns out to be natural in this context. We study key properties of the resulting tail process and demonstrate its ability to approximate conditional exceedance probabilities of a range of stochastic processes.

The majority of multivariate extreme value models (MEVMs) fail to account for such trends, motivating the need for novel developments.\nMany recent MEVMs utilise the geometric extremes framework, whereby extremal dependence features are inferred from the limiting shapes of scaled sample clouds. Such approaches possess many attractive features; for example, they can capture a wide range of dependence structures and can be used to estimate many practically relevant quantities.\nIn this work, we extend the geometric extremes framework to capture time-varying extremal dependence. Our proposed framework is more flexible compared to many existing non-stationary MVEMs and offers a wide variety of interesting use cases. Through rigorous simulation studies, we demonstrate that our proposed framework is both robust and accurate. To conclude, we apply our framework to return data from ‘The Magnificent 7,’ a group consisting of the world’s largest technology companies.\nJoint work with: J. Wadsworth, M. de Carvalho, B.

Hu (UofG)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary The multivariate generalized Pareto distribution (mGPD) is a common method for modelling extreme threshold exceedance probabilities in environmental and financial risk management. Despite its broad applicability, mGPD faces challenges due to the infinite possible parametrizations of its dependence function, with only a few parametric models available in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce GPDFlow, an innovative mGPD model that leverages normalizing flows to flexibly represent the dependence structure. Unlike traditional parametric mGPD approaches, GPDFlow does not impose explicit parametric assumptions on dependence, resulting in greater flexibility and enhanced performance. Additionally, GPDFlow allows direct inference of marginal parameters, providing insights into marginal tail behaviour. We derive tail dependence coefficients for GPDFlow, including a bivariate formulation, a d-dimensional extension, and an alternative measure for partial exceedance dependence. A general relationship between the bivariate tail dependence coefficient and the generative samples from normalizing flows is discussed. Through simulations and a practical application analyzing the risk among five major US banks, we demonstrate that GPDFlow significantly improves modelling accuracy and flexibility compared to traditional parametric methods.\nJoint work with: Daniela Castro-Camilo (UofG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n21/03/25 Data fusion and extremes: a match made in Bayesian heaven by D. Castro-Camilo (UofG)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary Data fusion models are increasingly used to combine in situ and remote-sensing data, providing a more complete and temporally detailed picture of environmental conditions. However, traditional Gaussian-based models tend to underestimate extreme pollution events, which can lead to inaccurate risk assessments. To tackle this, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical framework for data fusion grounded in extreme value theory. Our approach employs the Dirac-delta generalised Pareto distribution, allowing us to model both threshold and non-threshold exceedances while maintaining the temporal structure of extreme events. We apply this model to predict and describe censored threshold exceedances of PM2.5 pollution across Greater London, using remote sensing data from the EAC4 dataset (part of the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service) alongside in situ measurements from the UK’s Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN). Key contributions of our approach lie in our model’s ability to (1) preserve the temporal structure of both extreme and non-extreme events, (2) seamlessly integrate data with varying spatio-temporal resolutions while fully accounting for parameter uncertainties, and (3) generate a complete spatio-temporal dataset that calibrates remote-sensing observations to accurately capture local threshold exceedances, guided by in situ measurements. Our results demonstrate that the new approach outperforms both Gaussian-based models and standalone remote-sensing data, providing more accurate predictions of threshold exceedances. In fact, it reveals finer spatial patterns of PM2.5 pollution, such as higher concentrations near coastal areas, which were not captured by remote sensing data alone.\nJoint work with: M. Daniela Cuba (Agricarbon, UofG), Craig Wilkie (UofG) and Marian Scott (UofG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14/02/25 Radial generalized Pareto distributions for extreme multivariate risk by I. Papastathopoulos (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary We introduce a novel class of multivariate distributions, termed radial generalized Pareto distributions, which emerge as non-degenerate limits of radially recentered and rescaled exceedances above direction-dependent thresholds. This framework leverages a novel convergence to Poisson point processes for multivariate extremes, providing an overarching stochastic foundation for constructing distributions that exhibit stability properties, enabling extrapolation of risk in any direction within multivariate spaces. Our framework naturally leads to the notion of quantile and return sets which closely parallel related notions of quantile regions that are based on optimal transport approaches, but also leads to isotropic return sets that are exceeded with equal probability along any direction.\nWe develop a fully Bayesian inference framework for these multivariate distributions, utilising latent Gaussian processes. We also construct novel diagnostics for assessing the convergence to the limit distribution and validate our methods through simulations. Our methods are also applied to real-world data from hydrology and oceanography, demonstrating their broad applicability in risk analysis and their potential to inform decision-making in the presence of extreme events.\nJoint work with: Lambert De Monte (University of Edinburgh), Ryan Campbell (Lancaster University) and Haavard Rue (KAUST).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15/11/25 A Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Model for Cascading Extremes by M. de Carvalho (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary In this talk I will address the growing concern of cascading extreme events, such as a tsunami followed by an extreme earthquake, by presenting a novel method for risk assessment focused on these domino effects. The proposed method develops an extreme value theory framework within a Kolmogorov–Arnold Neural Network (KAN) to estimate the probability of one extreme event triggering another, as a function of a covariate or feature vector. Our approach is backed by exhaustive numerical studies and illustrated on a real-life application to seismology.\nJoint work with: C. Ferrer and R.

Richards (UofE)\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary he geometric representation for multivariate extremes, where data is split into radial and angular components and the radial component is modelled conditionally on the angle, provides an exciting new approach to modelling environmental data. Through a consideration of scaled sample clouds and limit sets, it provides a flexible, semi-parametric model for extremes that connects multiple classical extremal dependence measures; these include the coefficients of tail dependence and asymptotic independence, and parameters of the conditional extremes framework. Although the geometric approach is becoming an increasingly popular modelling tool for environmental data, its inference is limited to a low dimensional setting (d ≤ 3).\nWe propose here the first deep representation for geometric extremes. By leveraging the predictive power and computational scalability of neural networks, we construct asymptotically-justified yet flexible semi-parametric models for extremal dependence of high-dimensional data. We showcase the efficacy of our deep approach by modelling the complex extremal dependence between metocean variables sampled from the North Sea.\nJoint work with: Callum JR Murphy-Barltrop and Reetam Majumder\nSlides: click here"
