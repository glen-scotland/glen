Welcome to GLE$^2$N, a Scotland-based collaboration involving the School of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Glasgow (UofG), the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (UofE), and the School of Mathematical & Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University (HW).

GLE$^2$N brings together early-career and established researchers from UofG, UofE, and HW to exchange ideas and explore applied, theoretical, and methodological advancements in statistical risk analysis and extreme value theory (EVT).
