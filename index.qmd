Welcome to GLE$^2$N, a Scotland-based collaboration involving the School of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Glasgow (UofG), the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (UofE), and the School of Mathematical & Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University (HW).

GLE$^2$N brings together early-career and established researchers from UofG, UofE, and HW to exchange ideas and explore applied, theoretical, and methodological advancements in statistical risk analysis and extreme value theory (EVT).

### Objectives
- To enhance collaboration among Scotland/UK-based researchers interested in EVT.  
- To promote knowledge sharing within the community.  
- To support early-career researchers through networking and collaboration opportunities.

### Meetings
GLE$^2$N meetings are open to all staff and students from UofG, UofE, and HW. From 2026, our online meetings will be organised into **thematic session series**. Each series focuses on a specific sub-topic over five months, with talks and paper discussions designed to be closely connected. The aim is to develop a shared understanding of the area through a small number of coherent, linked sessions.

Each series begins with a two-hour foundational lecture. Subsequent sessions consist of:

**Reading group**: a discussion of a recent and relevant paper, led by one of our members.

**Research talk**: a presentation or brainstorming session in which a member shares ongoing work or new ideas.

The series concludes with an in-person wrap-up event. Further details are available under the Meetings tab.

### Why GLE$^2$N?
Our network's acronym, GLE$^2$N, is not only functional but also resonates with the phonetic charm of *glen*, a word of Gaelic origin. Traditionally, glen referred to the narrow valleys found in the rugged landscapes of Scotland and Ireland, but its use has since expanded to describe similar features worldwide.

Many Scottish place names, such as Glen Coe in the northern part of Argyll, trace their roots to the Gaelic word gleann. The beauty of these glens has inspired works by Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns, who wrote about Glenriddell, Glen Afton, and Loch Turret.
