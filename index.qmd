Welcome to GLE$^2$N, a Scotland-based collaboration involving the School of Mathematics & Statistics at the University of Glasgow (UofG), the School of Mathematics at the University of Edinburgh (UofE), and the School of Mathematical & Computer Sciences at Heriot-Watt University (HW).

GLE$^2$N brings together early-career and established researchers from UofG, UofE, and HW to exchange ideas and explore applied, theoretical, and methodological advancements in statistical risk analysis and extreme value theory (EVT).

### Objectives
- To enhance collaboration among Scotland/UK-based researchers interested in EVT.  
- To promote knowledge sharing within the community.  
- To support early-career researchers through networking and collaboration opportunities.  

Activities of GLEN are funded by a variety of stakeholders, including Prob_AI and GAIL (Generative AI Lab—University of Edinburgh)

### Meetings
GLE$^2$N meetings are open to all staff and students from UofG, UofE, and HW. Meetings are held monthly and follow a two-hour format:  
1. **Reading group:** A discussion of a recent piece of relevant literature, led by one of our members.  
2. **Research talk:** A presentation or brainstorming session where a member shares ongoing research or new ideas.  

Each session includes a 10-minute break between parts, and all meetings are conducted online via Zoom.

### Why GLE$^2$N?
Our network's acronym, GLE$^2$N, is not only functional but also resonates with the phonetic charm of *glen*, a word of Gaelic origin. Traditionally, glen referred to the narrow valleys found in the rugged landscapes of Scotland and Ireland, but its use has since expanded to describe similar features worldwide.

Many Scottish place names, such as Glen Coe in the northern part of Argyll, trace their roots to the Gaelic word gleann. The beauty of these glens has inspired works by Scotland's national poet, Robert Burns, who wrote about Glenriddell, Glen Afton, and Loch Turret.
