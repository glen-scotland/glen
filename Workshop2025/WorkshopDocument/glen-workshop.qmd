# About the workshop

This one-day workshop marks the first in-person meeting of the Glasgow–Edinburgh Extremes Network (GLE²N), taking place in December 2025 at the University of Glasgow. Since its launch in 2024, GLE²N has established a regular programme of online seminars, creating a vibrant community around extreme value theory and statistical risk analysis. The December event celebrates the network’s one-year anniversary and provides an opportunity to strengthen connections across Scotland and beyond.

The workshop will bring together a small group of around 25–30 participants, including students, early-career researchers, established academics, and colleagues from industry. It will focus on advances in extreme value theory and its applications to real-world problems, fostering collaborative discussions across disciplines and career stages.


**Goals**

<!-- - Showcase key findings and methodological contributions from the GEOBEx project. -->

- Facilitate dialogue on challenges and opportunities in modelling extremes.

- Encourage collaboration by bringing together researchers from academia and applied fields.

- Identify future directions for methodological and applied development and foster knowledge exchange.
    

We hope that this collective effort will pave the way for stronger interdisciplinary connections and more impactful applications of statistics of extremes.

# Abstracts

The grouping and sequence of talks aim to gradually build context—from general frameworks and national challenges to specific methods and applications—while maintaining variety and thematic coherence.

## Opening / Framing the Landscape [UPDATE]
\subsubsection[\textbf{Kirstin Strokorb } (University of Bath) \\Modelling of extreme excursions of stochastic processes in space and time: Foundations for a new tail process]{Marian Scott (University of Glasgow)}

**Title**: Modelling of extreme excursions of stochastic processes in space and time: Foundations for a new tail process

**Summary.** 
Extreme excursions of stochastic processes in space and time often appear to be more localized the more extreme they are. While classical stochastic processes in extreme value theory cannot model this effect, we introduce an adapted version, where a suitable domain-scaling can be incorporated to accommodate this behaviour. Our theory is inspired by the triangular array convergence of maxima of Gaussian processes to a Brown–Resnick process and turns out to be natural in this context. We study key properties of the resulting tail process and demonstrate its ability to approximate conditional exceedance probabilities of a range of stochastic processes. Joint work with Marco Oesting and Raphael de Fondeville (based on the preprint [https://publications.mfo.de/handle/mfo/4206](https://publications.mfo.de/handle/mfo/4206)).

# Proposed topics for discussion

Feel free to use the topics below as a guide—they’re entirely optional, so you’re welcome to include others or leave them out.

## Theme 1: Data Complexity and Integration

**Relevant talks**: Marian Scott, Claire Miller, Ben Marchant, Craig Wilkie

**Prompt questions**:

- What are the most pressing barriers to integrating heterogeneous environmental data sources?

- How can we balance model complexity with interpretability when fusing diverse datasets?

- Are there good examples of success (or failure) in multi-source integration we can learn from?
    

## Theme 2: Modelling Choices and Scalability

**Relevant talks**: Dave Miller, Israel Martínez-Hernández, Michael Tso

**Prompt questions**:

- What modelling approaches scale best to large or high-frequency datasets?

- How do we decide between simpler models (e.g., regression/GAMs) and complex hierarchical or functional models?

- What compromises have you made between model flexibility and computational feasibility?

## Theme 3: Decision-Driven Modelling

**Relevant talks**: Claire Miller, Claire Risley, Michael Tso

**Prompt questions**:

- How do we make our models useful for decision-makers and practitioners?

- What statistical uncertainties matter most in practice, and how should we communicate them?

- How do we build adaptive systems that react to real-time information?

## Theme 4: Collaboration and Co-Production

All talks are relevant here

**Prompt questions**:

- What has helped or hindered successful collaboration across academia, agencies, and industry?

- What would an ideal collaborative workflow look like for tackling a spatio-temporal environmental problem?

- Are there shared needs (e.g., open datasets, tools, training) that we could address together?
