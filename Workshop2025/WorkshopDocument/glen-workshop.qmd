# Location (TBC)

We will meet in Seminar Room 311B, located on the third floor of the Mathematics and Statistics Building ([Google map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/School+of+Mathematics+and+Statistics/@55.8726073,-4.2944843,871m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x488845cfd066d839:0xeab86bed8f92f0d0!8m2!3d55.8726073!4d-4.2944843!16s%2Fg%2F11ddzkn8v0?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDYwMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)). The room is accessible by both stairs and lift. The building is just a 6-minute walk from Hillhead subway station.

# Abstracts

The grouping and sequence of talks aim to gradually build context—from general frameworks and national challenges to specific methods and applications—while maintaining variety and thematic coherence.

## Discussion Themes

Throughout the day, attendees are encouraged to contribute ideas, questions, and provocations on the below themes using Post-it pads and themed sheets placed around the room. These contributions will be used in the afternoon discussion session.


### 1. Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration
*How can EVT more effectively contribute to interdisciplinary challenges (e.g., climate, finance, health)?*

Prompt questions:

- What barriers exist when applying EVT in other scientific domains, and how can we lower them?

- Are there successful case studies of EVT in interdisciplinary settings we can learn from?

- How do we establish sustained collaborations with practitioners in fields like climate science, finance, or public health?

### 2. Scalability & Computation
*What are the bottlenecks in applying EVT at scale, and how can we overcome them (e.g., INLA, neural approaches)?*

Prompt questions:

- Which EVT models or inference techniques are most computationally efficient at scale?

- What are the trade-offs between computational speed, model complexity, and interpretability?

- How can we leverage modern computing tools (e.g., GPU, parallelisation, variational inference) to scale EVT methods?

### 3. Bridging Theory and Practice
*How do we translate advanced EVT theory into tools usable by practitioners and stakeholders?*

Prompt questions:

- What makes a theoretical advance in EVT practically useful?

- How can we communicate EVT model assumptions and uncertainties to non-specialists?

- What types of user-friendly tools or software are most needed by practitioners?






## Discussion Activity Details

### Task 1: Theme Review (20 min)
- Each group collects their theme sheet.
- Review Post-it notes and prompt questions.
- Summarise key ideas and explore potential answers or alternative approaches.

### Task 2: Team Reports (15 min per team)
- Each team leader presents their group’s summary.
- A short follow-up discussion with the full group.
