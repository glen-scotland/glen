# Proposed topics for discussion

## Theme 1: Data Complexity and Integration

**Relevant talks**: Marian Scott, Claire Miller, Ben Marchant, Craig Wilkie

**Prompt questions**:
  
  - What are the most pressing barriers to integrating heterogeneous environmental data sources?
  
  - How can we balance model complexity with interpretability when fusing diverse datasets?
  
  - Are there good examples of success (or failure) in multi-source integration we can learn from?
  
  
## Theme 2: Modelling Choices and Scalability
  
  **Relevant talks**: Dave Miller, Israel Martínez-Hernández, Michael Tso

**Prompt questions**:
  
  - What modelling approaches scale best to large or high-frequency datasets?
  
  - How do we decide between simpler models (e.g., regression/GAMs) and complex hierarchical or functional models?
  
  - What compromises have you made between model flexibility and computational feasibility?
  

## Theme 3: Decision-Driven Modelling
  
  **Relevant talks**: Claire Miller, Claire Risley, Michael Tso

**Prompt questions**:
  
  - How do we make our models useful for decision-makers and practitioners?
  
  - What statistical uncertainties matter most in practice, and how should we communicate them?
  
  - How do we build adaptive systems that react to real-time information?
  

## Theme 4: Collaboration and Co-Production
  
  All talks are relevant here

**Prompt questions**:
  
  - What has helped or hindered successful collaboration across academia, agencies, and industry?
  
  - What would an ideal collaborative workflow look like for tackling a spatio-temporal environmental problem?
  
  - Are there shared needs (e.g., open datasets, tools, training) that we could address together?
